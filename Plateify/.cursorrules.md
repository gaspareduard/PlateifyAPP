#Project Overview

You are builduing a social app called Plateify that basically connects user based upon number plates. The app has a tinder like theme with swiping cards that are nearby users and also lets user search other user by inputing a number plate in a search view.

#Important rules you HAVE TO FOLLOW

1.	Single Source of Truth & Injection
	•	Only instantiate services once in PlateifyApp with @StateObject.
	•	Never call UserService() (or any service) inside a ViewModel or View—always inject via init or @EnvironmentObject.
    •   There is only one authenticationViewModel in PlateifyAPP with @StateObject and its passed trough a environmentObject

2.	Constructor Injection for ViewModels
	•	Every ViewModel must declare its dependencies in its initializer.
	•	Views instantiate their @StateObject var vm by passing exactly those dependencies down.
	•	Prohibit accessing @EnvironmentObject inside a ViewModel’s init.

3.	Clear View–ViewModel Boundary
	•	Views only bind to @Published properties and call VM methods.
	•	No direct Firestore, URLSession, or business logic in Views.
	•	All network/db calls live in Services; VMs orchestrate them.
    
4.	Services Are Pure & Reusable
    •   When implementing new services check the already existant ones.
	•	When adding data logic, extend existing services, don’t duplicate in a ViewModel.

5.	Async Patterns & Thread Safety
	•	Annotate all ObservableObjects (@MainActor).
	•	Use .task { await vm.action() } or Task { await vm.action() } in Views.
	•	No blocking or synchronous API calls in UI code.

6.	Error Handling
	•	VMs catch service errors, map to String (or custom enum), expose a single @Published var errorMessage.
	•	Views display alerts or inline messages based solely on VM state.

7.	Logging & Debugging
	•	Always add debug prints that must be prefixed with DEBUG: for easy filtering and readability.
	•	The debug statements should always be directly in the viewModels and not int the views.

8.	File & Folder Layout
	•	Views in Views/, ViewModels in ViewModels/, Services in Services/, etc.
